# nikola-v2gstack
Open source ISO 15118 communication implementation for Linux made for my Master Thesis at DTU Ris√∏.
Please note that it requires uses TLS/PolarSSL, OpenV2GStack and libmultitask. The stack is compatible with the amd64 and armv7 architectures.

Getting started:
- Download mbed TLS from https://tls.mbed.org/download or their git repository
- mbed TLS must be configured to use thread locks. This is done by uncommenting #define POLARSSL_THREADING_C and POLARSSL_THREADING_PTHREAD in include/polarssl/config.h.
- *make install* the mbed TLS libary
- *make* the nikola v2g stack

Things to note:
- I have made a custom makefile for OpenV2G. It can be located in utils/OpenV2G/Makefile
- The SLAC client implementation is programmed to work with the Qualcomm QCA7000 chip.
- The SLAC server is programmed to work with the Insys Powerline GP with SLAC device.
- The application layer messaging in the example folder only covers a reference AC implementation.

Bugs are still likely to be present. Please do not hesitate to create issues.


Working test bench setup:

Beaglebone <-Ethernet-> Insys Powerline GP with SLAC <-Power Line-> Insys Powerline without SLAC (QCA7000 based) <-Ethernet-> Beaglebone


A lot of credit to Joakim Sindholt for making his brilliant C multithreading library libmultitask, see https://github.com/zhasha/libmultitask.
Also thanks to Siemens and Insys for making OpenV2g, see http://openv2g.sourceforge.net/.
